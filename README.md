# DexLearn

Learning-based grasp synthesis baselines (e.g., diffusion model and normalizing flow) for dexterous hands, used in [BODex (ICRA 2025)](https://pku-epic.github.io/BODex/) and [Dexonomy (RSS 2025)](https://pku-epic.github.io/Dexonomy/)


## TODO list

- [x] Support BODex and Dexonomy datasets
- [x] Release grasp type classifier for Dexonomy

## Installation
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive --progress

conda create -n dexlearn python=3.10 
conda activate dexlearn

# pytorch
conda install -c conda-forge mkl=2020.2 -y
# The following command is just an example. In fact you can install any version of PyTorch campatible to your environment. 
conda install pytorch==2.0.1 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia 

# pytorch3d
# If you change the PyTorch version above, remember to change the version of PyTorch3D accordingly.
wget https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/cloud/pytorch3d/linux-64/pytorch3d-0.7.8-py310_cu118_pyt210.tar.bz2
conda install -y --use-local ./pytorch3d-0.7.8-py310_cu118_pyt210.tar.bz2


# Diffusers 
cd third_party/diffusers
pip install -e .
cd ...

# MinkowskiEngine
# If your CUDA version is 12.x, please refer to https://github.com/CiSong10/MinkowskiEngine and use its `cuda12-installation` branch instead.
cd third_party/MinkowskiEngine
sudo apt install libopenblas-dev
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-11.7
python setup.py install --blas=openblas
cd ...

# nflows
cd third_party/nflows
pip install -e .
cd ...

# dexlearn
pip install -e .
pip install numpy==1.26.4
pip install hydra-core
```
you may need to run the following command to avoid potential errors related to MKL such as `undefined symbol: iJIT_NotifyEvent`
```
conda install -c conda-forge mkl=2020.2 -y

## Getting Started
1. **Prepare assets**. Download Dexonomy dataset from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/JiayiChenPKU/Dexonomy). The folder should be organized as below:
```
DexLearn/assets
|- grasp
|   |_ Dexonomy_GRASP_shadow
|        |_ succ_collect
|_ object
    |- DGN_5k
    |   |- valid_split
    |   |- processed_data
    |   |- scene_cfg
    |   |_ vision_data
    |_ objaverse_5k
        |- valid_split
        |- processed_data
    |   |- scene_cfg
        |_ vision_data
```
Similarly, you can download BODex dataset from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/JiayiChenPKU/BODex). 

2. **Running**. 
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -m dexlearn.train exp_name=type1 algo=nflow data=dexonomy_shadow
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -m dexlearn.sample -e dexonomy_shadow_nflow_type1       
```
If you want to use our pre-trained models, please download the checkpoints from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/JiayiChenPKU/Dexonomy) and put them in the `output` folder.
```
DexLearn/output
|- dexonomy_shadow_nflow_cond
|   |- .hydra
|   |- ckpts
```
and then you can run the sampling command below:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -m dexlearn.sample -e dexonomy_shadow_nflow_cond algo.model.grasp_type_emb.use_predictor=True
```
Now we donot support the training of predictor for grasp type.

3. **Evaluating in simulation**: Please see [DexGraspBench](https://github.com/JYChen18/DexGraspBench?tab=readme-ov-file#running)
